# Stats
1. 12 slides

# Slide Breakdowns

First Slide
  * Project Title
  * Name
  * School
  * Research Center / Mentor

<br>

Second Slide
  * Introduction
   * Stats about AD
     * Talk about how doctors notes include plethora of info about AD situation for a patient
   * Discuss underultilization of doctor's notes

     * Dementia is severely underdiagnosed
   * Purpose
  
<br>

Third Slide
 * Framework
  * Acquisition of Data
  * ML techniques to predict Cognitive Impairment
    * LR / RFC / SVM
    * Diagram of Original Sequence, then depict conversion to preprocessed data and then converted into TFIDF vectors and feed into models, then CV folds 
  * DL techniques to predict Cognitive Impairment
    * BERT
    * Don't know diagram yet since haven't done BERT yet (assuming just model architecture w/ data pipelinew

Fourth Slide
 * Framework slide continued if needed
   * Findings besides stats
   * E.g. talk about words that have most correlation towards cognitive impairment

<br>

Fifth Slide
  * Findings
    * ACC / ROC / PPV / NPV / TP / FP / TN / FN
    * Graphs of Stats (E.g. boxplots)
