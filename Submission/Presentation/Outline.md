# Stats
1. 12 slides

# Slide Breakdowns

## First Slide
  * Project Title
  * Name
  * School
  * Research Center / Mentor

<br>

## Second Slide
  * Introduction
   * Stats about AD
     * Talk about how doctors notes include plethora of info about AD situation for a patient
   * Discuss underultilization of doctor's notes
     * General Purpose physicians lack skills to identify cognitive impairment and recommend ppl to specialist care
     * Notes are frequently never ultilized, accumualte over time despite valuable info 
     * Dementia is severely underdiagnosed
     * Not accurate tools to accurate classify 
  
<br>

## Third Slide
 * Purpose (Introduction Cont.)
   * Engineering Goals (think more about this)
     * High ACC
     * Non-invasive
     * Efficient

<br>

## Fourth Slide
 * Methods 
  * Acquisition of Data
  * ML techniques to predict Cognitive Impairment
    * LR / RFC / SVM
    * Diagram of Original Sequence, then depict conversion to preprocessed data and then converted into TFIDF vectors and feed into models, then CV folds 

<br>

## Fifth Slide
  * Methods Cont.
    * DL techniques to predict Cognitive Impairment
      * BERT
      * Don't know diagram yet since haven't done BERT yet (assuming just model architecture w/ data pipeline)
      
<br> 

## Sixth Slide
  * Findings
    * ACC / ROC / PPV / NPV / TP / FP / TN / FN
    * Graphs of Stats on validation / CV (E.g. boxplots)
    * Maybe also a sample sentence with output (Y / N / NTR, whether or not to recommend to specialist, flagged words)
